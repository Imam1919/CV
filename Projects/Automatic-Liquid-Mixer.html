        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            The automated liquid mixer is a completely innovative system created to revolutionize the process
            of preparing tailor-made liquid blends. It uses Bluetooth/Wi-Fi to communicate with very precise
            mechanical operations rather than traditional screens or physical buttons. Orders are only sent from
            a mobile app or website for user convenience.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            After receiving the order from the liquid mix made via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, it then sends this
            information over a wired connection to the Arduino Uno through a communication module. This
            signal flow is said to come from the TX pin of the module to the RX pin of the Arduino. And once the
            order comes in, it processes instructions that begin by checking the base. The base, a 20x10 cm
            platform, is 3D-printed, and such a base is where the cup is placed. A contact switch connected to
            pin 2 of the Arduino informs whether the contact switch had been placed correctly. If the base is not
            put in place correctly, Arduino moves the stepper motor that moves the base backward until it
            touches the contact switch. This ensures that the base is aligned properly and gets ready to move to
            the pump's dispensing position.

        </p>
        <p>
            
            The stepper motor is actuated by a stepper driver to move the base to the pump corresponding to
            any given order. It has its inputs connected from the Arduino to the stepper driver for step and
            direction signals using pins 3 and 4, while power to the driver is provided directly from an adapter.
            When the base reaches its appointed pump, the relay activates from the Arduino, which energizes
            the pump to pump the liquid into the cup. Each pump is installed vertically on a wooden frame and
            connected to two pipes: one liquid intake and another for dispensing into the cup. This is done for all
            necessary liquids in the mix, moving the base according to the programmed position of each pump.
            Once all liquids are dispensed, the base is returned to the home position. The stepper motor runs it
            backwards until it again touches the contact switch. Once again, the Arduino sends signal (code
            1010) to the mobile app or website, notifying that the mix of liquids is ready for picking up.
            Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are the ordering modes available in the system. This versatility will further allow
            a seamless connection of the user's device with the mixer. It is a very unique feature that completely
            replaces age-old ordering means with modern wireless ordering system from conventional ones
            embedded in some designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic design now comes equipped with features for the smooth and highly precise movement. It
            slides along two steel rods with the use of shifter and timing belts, with the stepper motor providing
            the motive power for motion control. The rods are held in place by 3D-printed holders with that on
            the right serving as the starting point. The pumps and electronics related to them which include the
            Arduino, communication module, stepper driver, and power adapter are arranged just by the side of
            the stepper motor for a neat wiring and operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the automated liquid mixer provides an extremely efficient mode of modernizing the way
            liquid mixes are prepared. Merging high-end modern communication technologies with highly
            precise mechanical systems, this then results in operations that are very seamless, accurate, and
            friendly to the user while significantly abating some of the otherwise high manual workloads that
            such preparations would normally require.
