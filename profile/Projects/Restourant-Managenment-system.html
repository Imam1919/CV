        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            There are five types of users for our system.
</p>
<p>
            1. Customer Class
            Customers interact with our system directly in order to place order, modify order, get bill and give feedback. We do not store any information related to customers in our system. The process of order taking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin.
        </p><p>
            2. Head Chef/Kitchen Manager
            Head Chef can mark a dish as prepared when a chef tells him to do so. He can approve the cancellation of an order whenever a customer edits or removes a dish from his order. He can also assign a dish to a particular chef based on the specialty of the chef.
            
        </p><p>

            3. Chef
            Chefs don’t interact with the system. They just have to look at the dishes present in their queues and prepare the dishes accordingly. Chef’s name, address and specialty etc. are stored in the database.
        </p><p>
            4. Admin
            Admin’s job is to manage the inventory and other information related to menu and chefs in the system.
        </p><p>
            5. Hall Manager
            Hall Managers will provide its input when he marks the bill as paid when customers pay for their order or get the bill printed. Moreover, he gets a notification whenever a particular order is complete, or some customer asks for help through the system. Hall manager can also see tables in the hall and their status i.e. empty or filled.
